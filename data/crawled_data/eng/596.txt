Buhari, Tinubu exchange Sallah greetings
Mr Buhari expressed his readiness to welcome Mr Tinubu to the State House as President on 29 May.
President Muhammadu Buhari and the incoming President, Bola Tinubu Friday morning exchanged Eid greetings in a phone call to mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The president’s media aide, Garba Shehu, confirmed this in a statement in Abuja.
The statement said “both leaders thanked God Almighty for seeing this day and prayed for the stability and the wellbeing of the nation.”
He said Mr Buhari expressed his readiness to welcome Mr Tinubu to the State House as President on 29 May.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had on 1 March declared Mr Tinubu of the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the 25 February presidential election.
Although, the declaration is being challenged in court by five parties, the president-elect, who is currently in Europe, will be inaugurated on 29 May when Mr Buhari’s second four-year term will end.
