10th National Assembly: APC retains majority in Senate with 59 senators-elect as PDP trails with 36 (FULL LIST)
The 109 senators-elect will be inaugurated on 13 June.
With the conclusion of the supplementary elections into the National Assembly across the country on Saturday, the 10th Senate has now been fully composed.
All the109 senatorial districts now have representatives in the upper chamber of the National Assembly.
The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) conducted elections into seven districts declared inconclusive on 25 February.
With the completion of the elections, the APC has emerged as the majority party in the Senate with 59 members-elect.
After the 25 February election, the party had 55 senators-elect but gained additional four seats during the supplementary polls. It won in Plateau Central, Yobe South, Sokoto North and Sokoto East senatorial districts.
The next biggest party in the Red Chamber is the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which now has 36 senators-elect.
Before last Saturday’s poll, the main opposition party had 33 senators-elect. At the end of that exercise, PDP added three additional seats having won in Sokoto South, Zamfara Central and Kebbi North Senatorial districts.
However, the other five minor parties still maintain the number of seats won in February as they did not win any seat during the supplementary elections.
While the Labour Party (LP) has the seats of eight senatorial districts, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) have two seats each. The Young Progressives Party and All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) have one seat each.
With the composition of the membership of the 10th Senate finalised, the six opposition parties have altogether 50 senators-elect as against APC’s 59.
It is therefore expected that they will play a major role in the battle for leadership positions in the upper legislative chamber during its inauguration on 13 June as was the case in the eight Senate.
During the election of the senate president and the deputy senate president of the eight Senate, although the APC was in the majority, the PDP played a significant role in the choice of the presiding officers.
Consequently, a PDP senator, Ike Ekweremadu was elected the deputy senate president while Bukola Saraki of the APC emerged the Senate President.
