Sallah: NSCIA sets up committee for moon sighting
The Council enjoined Muslims all over the country to look out for the announcement to be made by the Sultan on the night of Thursday 20th of April.
The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) under the leadership of its President-General and Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar, has announced a committee for the sighting of the month of Shawwal – marking the end of the Ramadan fast.
The NSCIA also congratulated the Nigerian Muslims on the occasion of the upcoming Sallah celebration while urging them to distribute the compulsory Zakatul Fitr (Compulsory food levy given to the needy on Sallah Day) on time.
The NSCIA in a statement through its Director of administration, Zubairu Usman-Ugwu, said the council beseeched Allah to grant everyone the opportunity to witness many more of the Sallah celebration.
“In the spirit of Ramadan, Muslims are reminded that Zakatul Fitr is a compulsory food levy imposed on privileged Muslims, to be given to the less privileged in the society. The Council, therefore, appeals to all concerned to ensure that they do not only comply but also comply on time.
“The stipulated practice is to give out the prescribed measurement to beneficiaries in the last two days of Ramadan and not later than before the ‘Id prayer, the NSCIA said.
The council said upon the advice of the National Moon-Sighting Committee (NMSC), the Sultan enjoined the Nigerian Muslim Ummah to search for the crescent of Shawwal 1444 A.H. immediately after sunset on Thursday, 29th Ramadan 1444 A.H. which is equivalent to 20th April.
“If the crescent is sighted by Muslims in accordance with the moon sighting and verification standards, then His Eminence would declare 21st April 2023 as the 1st of Shawwal and the day of ‘Idul Fitr (Day of Sallah). However, if the crescent is not sighted that day, then the 22nd, of April 2023, automatically becomes the day of Sallah.
“In addition to the established and traditional Islamic leaders in each locality, the following members of the National Moon-Sighting Committee (NMSC) can be contacted to report any credible and positive sighting of the crescent of Shawwal 1444 AH:
