He made several trips to the UK and France before the commencement of campaigns in 2022.
In October 2022, he spent 12 days in the UK. At a point, he had to release a short video clip of him walking out to address the speculations on his health.
He and his team have, however, said he is healthy enough to be president.
Mr Tinubu is due to be sworn in on 29 May.
