Collation of results resumes in Adamawa
The collation resumed around 3:40 p.m. under heavy security presence at the INEC collation centre in Yola, the state capital.
The collation of results of the supplementary election in Adamawa State has resumed.
The collation resumed around 3:40 p.m. under heavy security presence at the INEC collation centre in Yola, the state capital.
The spokesperson of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Festus Okoye, and INEC Returning Officer Mohammed Mele, are coordinating collation of the results.
The embattled Resident Electoral Commissioner of INEC in the state, Hudu Ari, had illegally declared candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Aisha Dahiru popularly called Binani, as winner of the election.
The controversy it generated forced INEC to immediately order suspension of the collation of result till further notice.
Mr Ari was also barred from the INEC office. The commission said it would write the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali, to investigate and prosecute Mr Ari.
Meanwhile, Mrs Dahiru whom Mr Ari illegally declared winner has approached a Federal High Court in Abuja to stop INEC from nullifying the illegal declaration.
