OAU hands over students accused of lynching colleague
“Nobody knows that students can go to that level of indiscipline to cost the life of their mate,” the OAU official said.
The management of the Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Osun State, says it has handed over suspects accused of the murder of a final-year student, Okoli Aishe, of the institution.
The Public Relations Officer of the University, Abiodun Olarewaj, stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Wednesday, in Ile-Ife.
He said the Vice-Chancellor, Simeon Bamire, and the entire community were saddened over the murder of the student.
“Nobody knows that students can go to that level of indiscipline to cost the life of their mate,” he said.
The spokesman stressed that the suspects should have adhered to the constitutional provisions and the university’s regulations rather than taking the law into their hands.
Mr Olarewaju said the university had set up a committee to unravel the circumstances leading to the gruesome murder of the student.
Aishe, a final-year student of the Civil Engineering Department was clobbered to death in a mob action after some students accused her of cell phone theft.
