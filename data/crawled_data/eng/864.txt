DATA: What the voting pattern in 2023 presidential election is telling us
In all 36 states, less than half of the eligible population turned out to vote, and only Jigawa state had a turnout above 40 per cent.
On February 25, Nigerians went to the polls to elect their preferred presidential candidates in the seventh general election since the end of military rule in 1999.
Since the beginning of the Fourth Republic, Nigeria has enjoyed uninterrupted democracy for 24 years, the longest stretch since its independence in 1960. Up to 93 million people in Africa’s most populous country and biggest economy registered to vote ahead of the 2023 elections.
The election produced Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), as Nigeria’s next president, extending the APC’s rule in Africa’s largest democracy.
Mr Tinubu, 70, scored 8,794,726 votes. His closest rival, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), scored 6,984,520 votes to emerge second in the election. Labour Party’s Peter Obi got a total of 6,101,533 votes while Rabiu Kwankwaso of the NNPP came fourth with 1,496,687 votes.
The national voter turnout was 29 per cent; no election had a lower participation rate in the six decades of Nigeria’s independence. Of the 93.4 million registered voters this year, 87.2 million people collected their Permanent Voters Card while the total number of actual voters on election day was only 24.9 million. Barely 9 million people voted for President-elect Tinubu to govern 220 million Nigerians.
In each of the 36 states, less than half of the eligible population turned out to vote, and only Jigawa State had a turnout above 40 per cent. While the northwestern state had a 41 per cent turnout, Plateau State recorded a 40 per cent turnout.
In the three largest states based on voter registration — Lagos, Kano and Rivers — less than a third of the eligible population voted. Rivers turnout was a shameful 16 per cent, the lowest in the country, despite producing a lot more votes in past elections, which though were criticised as violent and irregular by observers.
Only about ten states recorded more than 30 per cent turnout and participation in other states was a little more than 20 per cent.
Election participation in Osun was 39 per cent. This was followed by Adamawa – 35 per cent, Gombe – 34 per cent, Bauchi – 32 per cent, Ekiti – 32 per cent, Kaduna – 32 per cent, Katsina – 31 per cent, FCT – 30 per cent, and Niger – 30 per cent.

Lagos, Nigeria’s most populous state and the state with the highest number of eligible voters recorded an abysmal 19 per cent voter turnout amid reports of violence and voter suppression. The state was just a little above southeast Abia state where turnout was 18 per cent.
Participation was worse in Bayelsa and Rivers states with only 16 per cent of people turning out to vote in the oil-rich states.

The total votes cast in Lagos was 1.3 million; Plateau 1.1 million and 1.09 million in Katsina.

The South-south had 2.85 million and the South-east 2.2 million votes.
Bola Tinubu, the candidate of the APC secured the highest number of votes and a breakdown of data shows that he gained more votes than his rivals in three out of the six geopolitical zones. Mr Tinubu won in his South-west home; North-west and North-central.
In the three other regions he didn’t win, the former Lagos governor came second. This gave him the spread to be the only candidate that gained 25 per cent of votes in 29 states. Mr Tinubu also won at least one state in each of the regions except South-east.
LP’s Mr Obi won two regions (South-east and South-south) while PDP’s Atiku scored more votes in only one region (North-east). Mr Obi trailed Mr Tinubu in the North-central while Atiku came second in the South-west and North-west.
