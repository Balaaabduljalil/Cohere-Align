NBA sets up standing 20 committees on judiciary, law reform, others
The NBA standing committees have over 800 lawyers as members.
The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has set up 20 standing committees to help execute its agenda on different thematic areas, including the judiciary, law reform, anti-corruption, and others.
Yakubu Maikyau, the NBA president, announced this in a statement dated 15, which he released on Sunday.
He said the committees were constituted in accordance with section 14 of the association’s constitution, and ratified by the National Executive Council (NEC) in its quarterly meeting held on 23 March. The NBA NEC meeting was held in Birnin Kebbi, Kebbi State.
The standing committees of the NBA are reconstituted every two years after a new president takes over the leadership of the association.
Mr Maikyau, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), maintained the same number of standing committees as his predecessor, Olumide Akpata, but increased the membership by about 500.
Over 800 Nigerian lawyers, including the NBA president, made the membership lists of the 20 committees in the new appointments. Mr Akpata appointed 300 members spread across the same number of committees in February 2021.
Apart from the Mr Maikyau-headed Appointment and Remuneration Committee with only seven members, the membership of the rest of the 19 committees ranges from 36 to 51.
Mr Maikyau who took over as the 31st NBA president in August 2022, thanked members of the committees “for accepting this call to serve our noble association”. He also called on members of the association “to accord them the cooperation needed to deliver on their mandate.”
