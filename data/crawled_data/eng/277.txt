Nigerian stocks rally on scramble for Access Holdings’ shares
The all-share index grew by 83 basis points to 52,290.8, while market capitalisation climbed to N28.5 trillion
Nigerian stocks advanced for the first time this week on Thursday after the main equity index added 0.2 per cent on the back of continued brisk trade in the shares of Access Holdings.
Nigeria’s biggest lender by assets has now traded as many as 2.3 billion shares in the two weeks since 20 April, the day the corporation announced it would pay shareholders 50 per cent more in annual dividends for last year.
The stock has appreciated by 18.9 per cent since then.
Trade derived further strength from the gains recorded by GTCO and oil and gas firm Ardova.
“This week, we expect bullish sentiments to continue, as investors look to take advantage of fundamentally sound stocks with low pricings, with Q1-2023 earnings season already underway,” said analysts at United Capital in their outlook note seen by PREMIUM TIMES.
“However, we see room for pockets of profit-taking activities.”
Market breadth was positive as 32 gainers were reported compared to 18 decliners.
